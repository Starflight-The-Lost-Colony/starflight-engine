# Starflight Engine
This project started as a remastered edition of <i>Starflight The Lost Colony</i> by rewriting it from scratch using *Python* and *Pygame*. While we were digging into the old C++ sources and art, we just started making improvements and fixing old bugs and it turned out that the best way to remaster *The Lost Colony* is with the original codebase (dramatically improved with new features and gameplay).
The *Starflight Engine* will continue here with Python but will not be used for the TLC remaster. The most likely candidate for a prototype game will be a *Starflight 1 Remake*.

Very early prototype of the new engine:
